## [Unreleased]

### Features
- Harden the transfer orchestration service so retries are idempotent and never duplicate an on-chain submission: failure classification that refuses to retry ambiguous outcomes, a write-ahead attempt journal that survives idempotency-store eviction, jittered capped backoff under the shared retry budget and circuit breaker, per-attempt deadlines, and an operator reconciliation queue with metrics (#1043)
- Harden the vault comparison screen for multi-strategy selection: numeric strategy catalog with locale-aware formatting, URL-synced shareable selection and column ordering, best-in-class marking with non-colour cues, and screen-reader announcements for selection and sort changes (#1036)
- Add journalled partial-failure recovery for multi-step withdrawals: resume-forward retries, reverse-order compensation, an operator escalation queue with admin endpoints, and a background sweeper for crashed or backed-off sagas (#954)
- Add deterministic admin proposal nonces with replay rejection for admin rotation (#736)
- Add empty-state deposit and withdraw intent actions across dashboard pages (#734)
- CORS configuration for cross-origin API access

- Network badge showing testnet vs mainnet status in the frontend
- Add wallet activity heatmap aggregation endpoint for admin analytics without exposing raw wallet records (#712)
